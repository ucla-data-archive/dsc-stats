Hi Tim,

Thanks so much! It is hard to leave, but I'm also excited about what's next. These transitions always come with mixed emotions. :)

It was no problem to get that request! I'm happy to do it! I'm relatively aware of your Carpentries activities that include committee work for LC, instructor training and instructing and lessons, but if you could send me an overview that would be great of the activities you'd like me to highlight, that would be great. I have sentences planned like,

Tim has been very active and engaged in the Carpentries community and teaching, including teaching 6 bootcamp workshops and 11 short courses based on Carpentries open educational materials to over 700 learners at UCLA and 4 Library Carpentry Workshops in the US (Pittsburgh, USC, & Special Library Association Conference) and internationally (South Africa). He's also responsible for building a Carpentries instructor community at UCLA that now has 10 certified instructors and has reached over 900 learners through more than 50 formal Carpentries bootcamp workshops and short courses inspired by the Carpentries pedagogical best practices. 

He is also a certified and acting Instructor Trainer with The Carpentries, teaching 7 workshops to more than 150 trainees to be Carpentries instructors in the library and research community. This activity included a trip to South Africa to promote Library Carpentry and build instructor capacity as part of our African Taskforce.

So, general numbers there would be helpful.

Also, I know you've represented LC at various conferences and meetings. Do you have a list of those places that I could include?

Here's the Carpentries related presentations I've given:

* Taking The Carpentry Model To Librarians,	11/27/17	Washington, D.C.,		Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Fall 2017 Membership Meeting
* Library Carpentry. Software and data skills for library professionals,	6/8/18	Prague, Czech Republic,	European Library Automation Group (ELAG) 2018
* Building a UC Carpentries Community, 8/14/18	Davis, California, University of California Computing Services Conference 2018
* Creating Effective Workshops Using the Carpentries Inclusive pedagogy,	7/17/19	UC Santa Barbara, 	UC Tech (Technology conference for UCs)
* The Carpentries: Building Local and Global Communities of Practice to Improve Data Skills (Invited Speaker), 12/13/19, San Francisco, CA,	AGU Fall Meeting 2019

Other things I have of note:
- key in establishing Carpentries at San Diego
- on moving to UCLA, key in establishing Carpentries at UCLA
- on LC Committee establishing LC as a lesson program
- winner of The Carpentries 2018 Community award - 2018 award
- representing Carpentries and LC at many conferences, meetings and events (could use some detail there) - see above
- development of many LC lessons
- guidance of LC content and lesson focus generally including development of LC workshop structure
- maintainer of LC Unix, Tidy Data and R lessons

I'm sure there are things I missed! So, please do let me know other things I should highlight. This is chance for me to speak on your behalf, sharing all the awesome things you've done. Also, you know better than me what is important to your boss and department. So don't be shy in letting me know about things I might have missed, or where particular details would be helpful because they align with how you're being evaluated.

Happy new year, and hope things are going well!

Best,
-Tracy
